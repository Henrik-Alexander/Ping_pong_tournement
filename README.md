# Max Pong tournement
This file is used to created the pairings for the Max-Pong tournament.

# Software & Hardware
The analysis were executed in [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23 ucrt). The computing unit was platform x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit).
The program was running under Windows Server x64 (build 17763)

# Procedure
## 1. Data cleaning
Since some respondents where not able to stick to the provided scheme of chatecorising the skill level into low, medium or high, the variable values had to be cleaned in the first step. Secondly, some corrections had to be made, because some people clearly lacked self-esteem.

## 2. Splitting into groups
In the second step, the pool of players was split into two almost equally sized groups. For that purpose, high and low skilled players were selected for separate leagues. The medium experienced players were randomly assigned to either league 1 or league 2.

## 3. Random pairing
In the final step, the players in the two leagues were randomly assigned a partner.
